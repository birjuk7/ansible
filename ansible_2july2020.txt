setup steps
1 setup EC2 instance
2 setup hostname
3 create ansadmin user
4 add user to sudoers file
5 enable password based login
 


ssh-keygen
cd ~/.ssh
copy ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub of ansible-master-node to the host authorized key of known hosts
hence you are going to access passwordless login access

$visudo         ## for host machine
ansadmin  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL          ## add this line in file and exit
service sshd reload

vim /etc/ansible/hosts
[webserver]                           # any name or alias             
172.32.49.14               # private ip of hosts
[appserver]
172.32.13.171
[dbserver]
172.32.14.89

save & exit

in host machine
useradd -m -d /home/ansadmin ansadmin      ## adding user with home directory
passwd ansadmin

vim   /etc/ssh/sshd_config                ### in host machine
PasswordAuthentication yes             ##change from no to yes


vim /etc/ansible/hosts
ansible -m ping all
ansible -m ping production

ansible <HOST_GROUP> -m ping
ansible <HOST_GROUP> -m setup | less
ansible <HOST_GROUP> -m setup -a "filter=ansible_distribution*"

ansible all -a "/bin/echo hello"   Now run a live command on all of your nodes:

/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg                      ######## Config file, used if present

ansible all --list-hosts
